	<h5> Step 2: Heuristic review of the system </h5>
		<h6>1.Visibility of System Status</h6>
		<p>According to Nielsen’s first heuristic, systems should always keep users informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback 		within a reasonable time. The Tower Archive on JSTOR platform displays system status through visible indicators which show loading operations 		and navigation steps and content arrangement.</p>
		<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
			<li>The main page of the website includes an introduction to The Tower alongside the official CUA logo which helps users verify they 				are in the correct institutional archive. (Look at the picture:<span style="color:#9a031e; font-weight:bold;">red highlighter</span>)</li>
			<li>The search bar shows the total number of available items in the collection. (Look at the picture:<span style="color:#0f4c5c; font-weight:bold;">			blue highlighter</span>)</li>
			<li>The redefine search tool provides users with an enhanced tool which enables them to investigate the content further. 							The date range filter enables users to search by year but does not allow month and year searches which results in imprecise 						results. (Look at the picture:<span style="color:#e36414 ; font-weight:bold;">orange highlighter</span>)</li>
			<li>The archive organizes content through five twenty-year time segments which start from 1922 and extend up to 2018. The framework 						allows researchers to study particular time intervals within broad historical periods in great detail. I click one 							of them for this analysis. It takes you another page focus on that particular range of time. In my opinion it seems I am in 						the correct place but it overwhelming all its together and I can arrange by month only by year or oldest, newest or 							relevance. (Look at the picture:<span style="color:#5c374c ; font-weight:bold;">purple highlighter</span>)</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/assigment3/main/Visibility.png"alt="visibility2" style="border:2px solid #6b705c; max-width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" />
		
		<h6>2: Match Between the System and the Real World</h6>
		<p> Nielsen’s second heuristic emphasizes that systems should use language and concepts that are familiar to users.</p>
		<p> This is my analysis in The Tower Archive on JSTOR.</p>
			<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li> The archive uses standard academic and institutional language which includes “items” “search” and “collection” to match the terminology of academic research and meet user expectations.(Look at the 					picture:<span style="color:#585123 ; font-weight:bold;">Green highlighter</span>)</li>
				<li> The archive includes a visible content warning acknowledging that “some of the images and language in these issues may be seen as offensive to contemporary viewers.”The statement upholds real-world 					archival ethics because it maintains historical accuracy while providing essential background details for modern audiences.</li>
				<li> The design of JSTOR uses skeuomorphic elements through its feature which enables users to browse through detailed digital versions of newspapers while mimicking the sensation of handling printed 					newspapers. The search function in each issue allows users to search through the original content of the publication.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#f58549 ; font-weight:bold;">Orange 					highlighter</span>)</li>
				<li> The metadata for each issue contains only basic information which includes date and title. Adding subjects would improve the research methods because users could find content based on a particular 					theme. For example, tags such as sports,campus life, or politics would help research to examine how civil rights movements and social change shaped student life at campus. (Look at the 						picture:<span style="color:#083d77 ; font-weight:bold;">Dark Blue highlighter</span>)</li>	
			</ul>
				<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/assigment3/main/Real World.png"alt="real" style="border:2px solid #6b705c; max-width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto; 					margin-right:auto;" />
			
		<h6>3.User Control and Freedom</h6>
		<p>The Tower Archive demonstrates a satisfactory level of user control and freedom. For example: </p>
			<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li> The webpage allows users to return to the main page easily after selecting an item. The researchers have two options to continue their research by either revisiting their previous search results or 					exploring different sections of the archive.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#5c374c ; font-weight:bold;">Dark Purple highlighter</span>)</li>
				<li>The toolbar provides an “X” icon which lets users delete their past search criteria and filter selections. The tool successfully removes previous search results but lacks an undo feature which 						restricts users from recovering deleted filters or search terms.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#ce6a85  ; font-weight:bold;">Pink highlighter</span>)</li>
				<li>Users can apply filters in the Refine Results sidebar by selecting small boxes and validating their selections. The system enables users to move between search results in both directions which lets 					them modify or undo their selections before needing to begin a new search.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#ff8c61 ; font-weight:bold;">Orange highlighter</span>)</li>
			</ul>
			
				<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/assigment3/main/control.png"alt="control" style="border:2px solid #6b705c; max-width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;              				margin-right:auto;" />
		<h6>4: Consistency and Standards</h6>
		<p>The Tower Archive achieves a high degree of both internal and external consistency. The system preserves user expectations and enables navigation through JSTOR’s interface framework through its adoption of 				conventional visual symbols and consistent design elements.</p>
			<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">

				<li>Every page displays the official CUA logo which serves to maintain institutional identity and confirm users stay within the university's digital space.</li>
				<li>Every page and subcollection contains a search bar which shows the total number of available items while keeping navigation and feedback consistent throughout all sections.</li>
				<li>The download, save, copy and cite options on individual item pages use familiar standard icons. The symbols follow established digital research standards which make it easier for users who are new to 					the system.</li>
			</ul>
		<h6>5: Error Prevention</h6>
			<p>The Tower Archive prevents errors through its authentication requirement for saving content and its search parameter guidance system.</p>
			<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li>Users must log in through the system before they can access material saving. If you are not log in, A log in box will appear.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#a44200;font-weight:bold;">brown highlighter</span>)				</li>
				<li>An "!" sign and red box will appear if you use letters on the date boxes or if you don't type any information in the search box.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#9a031e;font-weight:bold;">red highlighter</span>)				</li>
			</ul>
				<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/assigment3/main/error.png"alt="error" style="border:2px solid #6b705c; max-width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;              				margin-right:auto;" />

		<h6>6: Recognition Rather than Recall</h6>
			<p> The Tower Archives does supports user recognization, but not completly. </p>
			<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li>The “Go Back” links serve as visual indicators which show users their return options to either the main page or their previous search results without requiring them to remember their navigation 						history.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#197278;font-weight:bold;">turquoise highlighter</span>)</li>
					
				<li>The CUA logo or name is throughtout each page of portal, this helps users understand they are within the CUA digital environment which creates trust and maintains their sense of direction.(Look at the picture:<span style="color:#5f0f40;font-weight:bold;">purple highlighter</span>)</li>
				<li>Recognition-based search effectiveness is limited. For example: As historian, I want to take a look at the attitudes on students about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The system failed to find any 						results when searching for student opinions about the Pearl Harbor bombing. It requires precise search terms or dates instead of understanding the context. Users need to depend on 							their memory because they cannot perform research due to insufficient available information.(Look at the picture:<span style="color: #e36414;font-weight:bold;">orange highlighter</span>)</li>
			</ul>
		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/assigment3/main/Recogniztion.png"alt="RECOG" style="border:2px solid #6b705c; max-width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;              				margin-right:auto;" />
			<h6>7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h6>
			<p>The Tower Archive on JSTOR demonstrates several features that support flexible and efficient research.</p>
			<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li>The “Cite” button enables users to select from various citation formats. The citation can be copied automatically with one click so users do not need to highlight text before copying it. </il>
				<li> Users can sort their search results through the “Sort by” tool which provides three options: relevance, oldest and newest.</li>
				<li>The CUA logo enables users to access the main university portal directly through a click which provides both a fast exit and a direct link to the institution.</li>
			</ul>
		<h6>8:Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h6>

			<p>The Tower Archive uses a simple design system which makes its content accessible to users.For example:</p>
			<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li>Throughout the homepage and subpages, images of The Tower newspaper are shown which proves that users are looking at the correct collection.</li>
				<li>The BCE date option in the search tool is unnecessary, as all content belongs to the Common Era. Deleting this would create a simpler interface which would prevent users from getting confused.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h6>9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</h6>
		
		
				<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li>The system provides search error suggestions when users enter incorrect words by showing the correct term for example when I typed “Womin” instead of “Women”. If you accept The suggestion, the link 					would leads to a complete CUA JSTOR database search instead of staying within The Tower Archive.</li>
				</ul>
		<p>After the mistake was made </p>
		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/assigment3/main/help1.png"alt="Help1" style="border:2px solid #6b705c; max-width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;              				margin-right:auto;" />
		<p> After I decided to take the suggestion.</p>
		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/assigment3/main/help2.png"alt="Help2" style="border:2px solid #6b705c; max-width:55%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;              				margin-right:auto;" />
		

		<h6>10: Help and Documentation</h6>
			<p>The last heuristic requires that users have access to help resources and documentation which must be available to assist them when they encounter difficulties. In my opinion, based on my observation, the site 				lacks helps options.</p>
			
		<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li> The site keeps track of search history which allows users to find their previous search.</li>
				<li> JSTOR has a help search section. It explains how to do a search overall. However, it lacks collection-specific guidance for The Tower Archive itself.</li>
				<li> It does hava any contant information link to the university, so you would have to go back to the library website.</li>

		<tr>
			<td> 1.</td>
			<td> It has a clear system, throughtout its homepage and subpages it keeps users informed where they are. The systems redirects you to a specific page after clicking.</td>
			<td> It has limited precision in the searchbox, it only allows search by year in the refine search box. Also, the result layout it overwhelming in my opinion.</td>

		<tr>
			<td> 2. </td>
			<td> The site has different features that support user control, effciency, and recognition. I really like the Skeuomorphic scrolling, which help user feels like a real newspaper. </td>

	<h5> Step 4: Submit the forms. (They were submitted in Blackboard) </h5>
		<ul style=text-align:left;font-family:Takoma;font-size:24px;color:#335c67;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li> Questionnaire Form</li>
				<li> Observation Form </li>
		</ul>

	<h5> Step 5:Compare results </h5>
		<p>The archive's chronological structure received positive feedback from both the heuristic analysis and the mini-usability test. The 20-year groupings in JSTOR help users perform targeted searches. According to my friend, she appreciated the date-based section organization. The search function received the same criticism from both evaluations because it lacks precision and has restricted search capabilities. The date filter operates at a yearly level only according to your heuristic review but searches cannot be filtered down by month. The search function failed to give results for my friend during her test. Instead, she needed to examine each issue independently which showed that the system lacks sufficient status visibility and recognition versus recall support.</p>

<p>In addition, the mini-usability test revealed additional usability problems which I did not detect while I conducted the heuristic analysis. My friend encountered three different problems during her test which included poor image quality and scrolling issues and difficulties with page navigation to the beginning. My heuristic review analyzed how different terminology and limited metadata and too many visual elements impact the interface. My friend’s evaluation results show that the system requires improvements through the addition of month-based date filtering and enhanced search capabilities for items and navigation buttons and better image quality and improved scrolling performance.</p>
